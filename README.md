**How to run the script:**  
---
Just copy it and paste it in your `executor`
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/dNk3rFfB"))()
```
Script Feature:
---
```
Auto farm 🍎    
Auto buy seed-shop 🌱 & gear shop ⚙️    
Anti AFK   
Infinite Jump
```  
Executor App used: `Delta`   
---  
I'm not sure if this script will run on other executor. Try it hihihi

The script is unfinished because my phone died. Planning to continue building it and I think I'm going to add `GUI`   
since it's just a *ready to run script.*  

It's safe, you can see the source code inside the `scripts folder`
